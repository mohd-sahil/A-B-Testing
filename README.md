### Concept of A/B Testing

In A/B testing, A refers to ‘control’ or the original testing variable. Whereas B refers to ‘variation’ or a new version of the original testing variable.

We can perform the A/B test on the following:
   * Site Pages, Flow, and Elements
   * Business Model
   * Backend Functionality and Algorithms
   * New Products or Services

The benefits of using A/B tests are as follows:

  * Increase Revenue and Conversions
  * Rapid Iteration
  * Learn what works
  * Uses Actual Site Visitors
  * Data-Driven Decision Making

**Therefore A/B testing is required for solving the business problems in a scientific way**
